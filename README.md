# ModernWeddingPhotoBooth

An iPadOS photo booth app designed for a wedding celebration, built in Swift using SwiftUI. It has a countdown timer for 3 photos, formats the captures as a photostrip, and allows users to share their photostrip.

Originally created for a relative's wedding, but this one scrubs personal info. You can fork it and change Strings.swift where relevant to use for your wedding.

- Front-facing camera support
- Countdown timer before each photo is taken
- Photos are saved to the iPad's photo library
